		<p>Hello, I am a student at the University of the Immaculate Conception. We were assigned to create a site design of our choice. Computers and laptops are the focus of my site design. This design may include HTML code that links to the product's website(note the hyperlink or the redirect link will work if you click the word or the red rectangle with the product's name. And make sure you have a Internet connection otherwise it will not work). This is solely for project proposals and will not be published on the web. The website is likewise built on a single brand, which is ASUS. The ROG series is theoretically the best option for me. The Republic of Gamers is a testing ground for those seeking greatness and pushing boundaries. Each battle scar is a symbol of valor and the cost of triumph.
